Rapid TeXing is a fun way of learning LaTeX and improving your typing speed, as well as competing with your friends! 

Our product was inspired by the online TypeRacer game (https://play.typeracer.com/) which tests your typing speed against that of your friends. We wanted to make the process of learning LaTeX more fun by creating a similar game that involves typing LaTeX equations rather than normal sentences.

Using the pygame module, we developed our project to contain three different levels of difficulty. The player can decide how many rounds to play in each game and their time is measured. The seed for each game is also displayed at the top of the screen so their friends can use the same seed and compete directly for the fastest time.

In the future, we hope to improve the game's visual appearance and create an online version of the game, so that people can see their friends progress in real time. We would also like to add a tutorial level to the game for complete beginners, and a button that will provide short hints.
